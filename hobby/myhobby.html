        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <h3>I love teaching,seeing my keen interest in it as a profession ,I started teaching the foundation classes og the institute at the institute from which I completed my JEE journey.I used to teach Mathematics and Physics to student of classes IX & X.
           <br/> I continued this hobby for almost two years until I completed my 2nd semester of my college.
        The students are still in touch with me which is the most valuable thing I earned from this hobby. </h3>
